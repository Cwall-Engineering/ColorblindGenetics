# ColorblindGenetics
This code allows the user to see a punnett square that determines colorblindness. The user inputs a number for the male (1 is normal, 2 is colorblind), and inputs a number for the female (1 for normal, 2 for carrier, and 3 for colorblind). The code then displays a punnett square displaying whatever information that was input.
